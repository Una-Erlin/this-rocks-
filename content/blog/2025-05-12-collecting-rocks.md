When I was a child I used to go hiking all the time with my dad and younger brother. We were very eager and competitive climbers, so the hikes were usually more of a race to the top than a relaxing walk. On these hikes we also used to put every single rock we found interesting or beautiful. Our backpacks were more often way heavier on our way down the mountain. We had no use for these rocks, they had no value other than our aesthetic appreciation for them. Still, to this day there sits a shelf in our backgarden - every shelf loaded with rocks so much so that the wood bends under the weight of them. I never look at the rocks anymore. They just sit there, forgotten reminders of childhood victories over nature.
