description: People collect rocks for all sorts of reasons, often starting with
  simple curiosity. The variety in color, shape, texture, and even sparkle can
  be surprisingly captivating. For some, it’s a way to connect with nature or
  remember a special place—like picking up a smooth stone from a favorite hike
  or beach. Others are drawn to the science behind it, using their collection to
  learn more about geology, Earth’s history, or how different types of rocks
  form. Whether for beauty, education, or just the quiet satisfaction of finding
  something unique, rock collecting can be a personal and meaningful hobby.

Rocks are Earth’s ultimate storytellers—they’ve been around for billions of years and have seen *everything*. Some are born in fiery volcanoes (igneous), others form from squished-together bits of ancient stuff (sedimentary), and some get a total makeover deep underground (metamorphic). They’re always on the move through the rock cycle, like nature’s version of a costume change. You can find them everywhere—from glittery crystals to fossils of long-gone creatures. So next time you see a rock, remember: it’s not just a boring lump—it’s a piece of Earth’s epic adventure!

Rocks are solid, naturally occurring substances made of minerals or mineraloids. They are classified into three main types: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic, based on how they form. Igneous rocks form from cooled magma or lava, sedimentary rocks form from compacted sediments, and metamorphic rocks result from transformation under heat and pressure. Rocks constantly change over time through the rock cycle, shifting between types. They are essential to Earth’s structure and provide clues about the planet’s history and processes.
